# project: Greenweez Finance - includes ads costs

------------------------------------


#project goal: 
-- include an advertising costs in the report
-- the goald is to include ads_costs in gwz_finance_day in order to calculate ads_margin
-- ads_margin is equal to margin_operational minuds ads_cost


------ Adding Advertisement cost to the financial report -----


# testing: for gwz_campaing primary key
-- tests results : there is no data to display 
-- table primary key is a concanation between date_date and campaing_name

SELECT

# creating: gwz_campaing_day table

-- calculating ad_margin
-- goal to reach gwz_finance_day and gwz_campaing to calculate ads_margin
-- Joining gwz_campaing with gwz_finance_day on date_date is a n:1 relationship
-- this would cause duplication on the gwz_campaing and thus ads_costs would be duplicated
-- proceding to aggregate gwz_campaing on date_date with date_date as the key


SELECT

-- insight: 
-- there is an increase on the number of transaction during the last 2 months
-- turnover has increased during the last 2 months 
-- average basket has had an increase over the last 2 months 
-- there is a decrease in the margin
-- margin percent decrease over the last 2 months by 2.6%
