---------------------------Table Link and Relationship----------------------------------

#the link between gwz_sales and gwz_product is the product id
# The link between gwz_sales and gwz_product is the products_id.In gwz_sales, we have one line per product composing the order. For a product_id, we can have several orders_id, and thus several lines.In gwz_product, we have one line per product_id.
#This is an N:1 relationship.
