------ project goal: 
-- testing tables for primary key:


# testing: gwz_orders_operational for primary keys
-- tests results : there is no data to display 
-- orders_id is primary key, no duplication found

SELECT 
--- key ----
  orders_id,
-------------
  COUNT(*) AS nb
FROM `first-project-408000.course16.gwz_orders_operational`
GROUP BY 
  orders_id
HAVING nb>=2
ORDER BY nb DESC


# testing: for gwz_order_operational Joined query with gwz_ship
-- checking that non of the columns in the joined query contain null values 
-- tests results : there is no data to display 
-- the thest therefore verifies that all orders_id of gwz_orders are present in gwz_ship

SELECT
  sh.orders_id,
  op.orders_id
FROM `first-project-408000.course16.gwz_ship` sh
LEFT JOIN `first-project-408000.course16.gwz_orders_operational` op
ON sh.orders_id = op.orders_id
WHERE TRUE
  AND sh.orders_id IS NULL;


# comparing number of rows 
#gwz_ship-> 167552
#gwz_orders_operational-> 167551
# Explanation -> orders_id = 1002564 is in gwz_ship but not in gwz_orders_operational

# A)
